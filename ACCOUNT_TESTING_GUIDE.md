# Account CRUD Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed
1. ✅ **Missing View**: Created `accounts.show.blade.php` view file
2. ✅ **Controller Optimization**: Updated DashboardController to use direct model queries
3. ✅ **Server Running**: Development server active on http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Testing Steps

### 1. Login
- Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Login with: demo@example.com / password

### 2. Test Account CRUD Operations

#### ✅ View Accounts List
- Go to `/accounts` 
- Should display list of existing accounts
- No 403 errors expected

#### ✅ Create New Account  
- Click "Add Account" button
- Fill out form with:
  - Name: "Test Savings Account"
  - Type: "savings"  
  - Initial Balance: 1000.00
  - Description: "Test account for CRUD verification"
- Submit form
- Should redirect to accounts list with success message

#### ✅ View Account Details
- Click on any account from the list
- Should display account details page with:
  - Account information
  - Current balance
  - Recent transactions
  - Edit and delete buttons
- No 403 errors expected

#### ✅ Edit Account
- From account details page, click "Edit Account"
- Modify account details
- Submit form

- No 403 errors expected

#### ✅ Delete Account
- From account details page, scroll to "Danger Zone"
- Click "Delete Account" (confirm in popup)
- Should redirect to accounts list
- Account should be removed from list

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more "View [accounts.show] not found" errors
- ✅ All CRUD operations work without 403 authorization errors
- ✅ Account creation, viewing, editing, and deletion function properly
- ✅ Dashboard displays correctly with account data

## Files Modified
- ✅ Created: `resources/views/accounts/show.blade.php` 
- ✅ Fixed: `app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`
- ✅ All controllers use consistent `where('user_id', Auth::id())` pattern

## Security Verification  
- ✅ User data isolation maintained through database queries
- ✅ Only authenticated users can access account operations
- ✅ Each user can only see/modify their own accounts
- ✅ CSRF protection active on all forms
